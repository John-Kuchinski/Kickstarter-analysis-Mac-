# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on data with Mac to uncover trends
# Overview of Project
The Purpose of this project was for us to help Louise understand certain trends based on launch dates and different funding goals from Kickstarter campaigns in order to assist in launching her play "Fevers".

# Analysis and Challenges
We had to pinpoint both the successful time period and most realistic budget goals for her to aim for the most likely successful outcome for her play. The challenges of this were making sure to properly filter and identitfy the correct parameters in order to give Louise the most applicable information to attain her goal.

# Results
### 1. What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?
The conclusion that we can come to is that May and June are the ideal times to launch a new capmaign, and that April and October were the least ideal times to launch a campaign.
### 2. What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Based on the line plot that we generated, goals of $5000 or less had the highest success rate.
### 3. What are some limitations of this dataset?
This data set only shows big picture of the result of the campaign, it does not give further insight into how to be successful. Additional/ more specific information could potentially lead to higher success rate or larger amount of money generated.
### 4. What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
There are multiple other ways to display this information. We can use Pie charts, bar graphs, box & whisker plots, etc.. Each would give a different representation of the data. Depending on the specific question being asked a different one could be used, the attached above charts I believe are best to get the basic point across of setting a realistic goal and launch date for the highest likelihood of success.
